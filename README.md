1. Place all files in a folder (e.g., `KYO_QA_ServiceNow_Knowledge_Tool_v25.1.0`).
2. Install Python 3.11.x or place portable Python in `python-3.11.9`. Optionally, install Tesseract or place in `tesseract` folder.
3. Run `START.bat` (Windows) or `python start_tool.py`:
   - Sets up `/venv/` and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Outputs logs to `/logs/` and Excel to `/output/`.
4. Manual setup (if needed):

   ```bash

   cd KYO_QA_ServiceNow_Knowledge_Tool_v25.1.0

   rmdir /S /Q venv
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ensurepip --default-pip
   venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
   venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
   python kyo_qa_tool_app.py
   ```

### 4. Usage

1. Launch the tool via `START.bat` or `python start_tool.py`.
2. Select an Excel file with a ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù column (case-insensitive).
3. Select a folder or PDF files (`.pdf` or `.zip`) containing Kyocera QA/service documents.
4. Click "Start Processing" to:
   - Extract model numbers (e.g., `PF-740`, `TASKalfa AB-1234abcd`), QA numbers, and metadata.
   - Update blank ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù cells in a cloned Excel file.
   - Save text files for failed or incomplete extractions in `PDF_TXT/needs_review`.
5. Review output in `/output/cloned_<excel>.xlsx` and logs in `/logs/` or `PDF_TXT/needs_review`.

### Custom Pattern Filtering and Rescan

- Click **Patterns** in the main window to edit regex filters stored in `custom_patterns.py`.
- Use **Re-run Flagged** to process files from the `PDF_TXT/needs_review` folder again.
- Both custom and built-in patterns are applied during each run.

### 5. Development and Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Requires `pandas`, `PyMuPDF`, `PySide6`, `openpyxl`, `pytesseract`, `python-dateutil`, `colorama`, `Pillow`, and `ollama`. Ensure Tesseract is installed or in `tesseract` folder for OCR tests.

### 6. Command-Line Usage (Alpha)

You can experiment with a simple CLI by running:

```bash
python cli_runner.py --folder <PDF_folder> --excel <template.xlsx>

# KYO QA ServiceNow Knowledge Tool

The KYO QA ServiceNow Knowledge Tool is a desktop application designed to automate the process of extracting key information from PDF documents. It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to handle scanned documents and a flexible pattern-matching system to find product models and other data, which it then populates into a master Excel file.

### **Features**
* **Automated PDF Processing**: Process hundreds of PDF files from a selected folder or by individual selection.
* **OCR for Scanned Documents**: Automatically detects image-based PDFs and uses Tesseract OCR to extract text.
* **Dynamic Pattern Management**: A built-in review tool allows users to add and manage custom Regular Expression (regex) patterns on-the-fly to support new document formats.
* **Rich User Feedback**: The user interface provides real-time feedback on the current process, including a progress bar, colored status indicators, and detailed logs.
* **Automated Environment Setup**: A smart startup script handles the creation of a virtual environment and installation of all required dependencies.

## **Installation Guide**
This guide provides instructions for setting up the necessary software on a Windows 11 system.

### **1. Install Python 3.9+**
The application requires Python to run.

* **Download**: Get the **Windows installer (64-bit)** for the latest stable version of Python (e.g., Python 3.11.x) from the official website:
    * **[Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)**
* **Install and Add to PATH**:
    1.  Run the downloaded installer.
    2.  **Important**: On the first screen of the installer, check the box at the bottom that says **"Add python.exe to PATH."**
    3.  Click **"Install Now"** and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
* **Verify Installation**:
    1.  Open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`).
    2.  Type `python --version` and press Enter.
    3.  If it shows a version number (e.g., `Python 3.11.9`), the installation was successful.

### **2. Install Tesseract-OCR**
Tesseract is required for the OCR functionality to read scanned documents.

* **Download**: The recommended installer for Windows is provided by UB Mannheim.
    * **[Tesseract at UB Mannheim Download Page](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)**
* **Install and Add to PATH**:
    1.  Download and run the `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-*.exe` installer.
    2.  Proceed through the installation wizard. When you get to the "Select Additional Tasks" screen, ensure that **"Add Tesseract to system PATH for all users"** (or "for current user") is checked.
    3.  Complete the installation.
* **Verify Installation**:
    1.  Open a **new** Command Prompt window.
    2.  Type `tesseract --version` and press Enter.
    3.  If it shows version information (e.g., `tesseract 5.3.4`), the installation was successful.

### **3. Set Up the Application**
With the prerequisites installed, you can now run the tool.

1.  **Icons (Optional)**: For the best visual experience, create a folder named `assets` in the main project directory. Place 16x16 pixel `.png` icons in this folder with the following names: `start.png`, `pause.png`, `stop.png`, `rerun.png`, `open.png`, `browse.png`, `patterns.png`, `exit.png`.
2.  **Run the Launcher**: Simply double-click the **`START.bat`** file.
    * The first time you run it, a setup process will create a virtual environment and install all necessary Python packages. This may take several minutes.
    * Once setup is complete, the main application window will launch automatically.

## **How to Use**

1.  **Select Excel File**: Click the first **Browse...** button to select the master `kb_knowledge.xlsx` file you want to use as a template.
2.  **Select PDFs**: Choose either a folder containing all your PDFs or select individual PDF files using the other browse buttons.
3.  **Start Processing**: Click the large red **START** button.
4.  **Monitor Progress**:
    * The **status bar** will change color to show what's happening (Processing, OCR, AI).
    * The **progress bar** will show the overall job completion.
    * The **counters** will update in real-time to show how many files have passed, failed, or need review.
    * The **log viewer** and **live terminal** tabs provide detailed, timestamped messages.

---
## **Managing Extraction Patterns**

When the tool encounters a PDF where it cannot find a model number, it will flag the file for **"Needs Review."** This is your opportunity to teach the tool how to handle new or unusual document formats.

1.  **Identify a File for Review**: After a job completes, look for files in the "Files to Review" list in the UI.
2.  **Open the Pattern Manager**: Click the **Patterns** button in the "Process & Manage" section. This will open the pattern management window.
3.  **Generate a Suggested Pattern**:
    * The text of the PDF will appear on the right side of the window.
    * Find and **highlight** the model number or QA number that the tool missed.
    * Click the **Suggest from Highlight** button. A new regex pattern will be automatically generated in the "Test / Edit Pattern" box.
4.  **Test and Refine**:
    * Click the **Test Pattern** button. All matches found by the new pattern will be highlighted in the text viewer, confirming that it works.
    * You can manually edit the pattern in the box if it needs refinement.
5.  **Add and Save the New Pattern**:
    * Once you're satisfied with the pattern, click **Add as New** or **Update List** to add it to the pattern list on the left.
    * Click the red **Save All Patterns** button. This saves your new pattern to a `custom_patterns.py` file.

The tool will now use your new pattern in all future jobs. For the changes to apply to the currently flagged files, you can use the **Re-run Flagged** button in the main window.
